      <h4 align="center">HealthCare Savings Email Series</h4>
      
      <p>We have put together emails that can be used with the HealthCare Savings campaign on Cliently.&nbsp; You can use these emails, in the order suggested, or mix them up, add to it etc.</p>
      
      <p>Please let us know which emails (from below or your own) are giving you the most success.</p>
      
      <p>Be sure to change the name, phone number and contact info to your own.</p><p><br></p>
      
      <h4><strong>Subject Lines</strong></h4>
      
      <p>we have found that using the words "health benefits billing" (without the quotes) in lowercase tends to work the best because if the contact is involved with paying the health benefits, they will tend to open your email.&nbsp; If they are not involved in paying health benefits, we really do not care if they open the email.</p>
      
      <p>It is possible to increase opens by tricking the recipient into opening the email however we have found that those recipients mark the emails as spam, which may get your email shut down by your email service provider (Google or Microsoft).</p>
      
      <p>For the first email in the sequence, you would use "accounts payable" as the subject line and for all subsequent emails in the sequence, you would use "RE: accounts payable" as the subject line.</p>

      <h4><strong>Pro Tips</strong></h4>
      
      <p>Be proactive to maximize your results...</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Pick up the phone and your call leads.&nbsp; Call those who have opened your emails the same day.<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>Send a LinkedIn connection request to those who have opened your email.&nbsp; Once they accept, give them a call or send them an email thanking them for accepting your connection request... etc.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>The phrase "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results" has been incorrectly attributed to Einstein but it is no less true.</p>
      
        <p>While the cost of employee healthcare continues to rise each year, almost all attempts by employers and the government to reign in these costs have failed. Watch this video to learn about the real problem with healthcare in the U.S. https://player.vimeo.com/video/209009087</p>
      
        <p>We don't sell insurance, we address the medical billing issue that drives the costs.&nbsp; I would love to share how we are helping our clients to reduce their health benefit cost, typically by 12 to 25%, or more, and without necessarily changing their broker or changing their health plan provider.</p>
