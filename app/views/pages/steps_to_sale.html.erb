      <h4><strong>Steps to the Virtual Card Payment Sale</strong></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Build list of businesses that can benefit from Virtual Card Payments. These would typically be businesses with an annual revenue of over $100 Million, since idealy we are looking for organizations that have over $40 Million in accounts payable annually ($10M Minimum).<br>
          <br></li>
        <li>Contact CFOs, Controllers, AP Managers, etc. and either give an elevator pitch or use the high level intro presentation.<br>
        <br></li>
        <li>At the end of your elevator pitch or intro presentation, close for scheduling a 2nd, more in depth, presentation where a subject Matter Expert (SME) at Priority Commercial Payments will go deep and also answer all of their questions.  We'll refer to this as the SME presentation.  If you are asked a question that you cannot answer, just let them know that you we will answer any and all of their questions on this in depth presentation.  In fact, thy should invite any and all memebers of their team who would have the best questions.<br>
          <br></li>
        <li>Use the Calendly scheduling link to schedule this presentation with the SME. 
        Be sure to enter your information as well as your prospects information.  Enter Your Name and Your Email address and then click on "+ Additional guests" and enter your prospect's email address. Then complete the remainder of the form.<br>
          <br></li>
        <li>Emails will be automatically sent to you and to your prospective client with the screenshare link for the SME meeting. <em>This will be your client and you need to manage the relationship, so you must join either, at the client's location, or online for this presentation.</em><br>
          <br></li>
        <li>Enter the prospect in the Aspire CRM<br>
        <br></li>
        <li>The SME presentation is conducted, and at the conclusion of the presentation, the presenter will ask for supplier data needed for a Supplier Match presentation.<br>
          <br></li>
        <li>You must go ahead and schedule the Supplier Match and Platform demo before ending the presentation. <em>By scheduling the Supplier Match & Platform demo at the end of this initial presentation, you are creating urgency in providing the supplier data.  Note that we are scheduling an arbitrary date at this point, to keep the ball rolling and create urgency in providing the data. The actual Supplier Match presentation and platform demo date is to be scheduled, only after receipt of the supplier data. You should also obtain the name, phone extension, and email address, of the person who will be getting the supplier data for you.</em><br>
          <br></li>

        <li>Upon receipt of the supplier data, call the prospect and let them know that you received the data and reschedule the Supplier Match presentation and platform demo. If you have not been speaking with the CFO (decision maker) up to this point, be sure to ask your prospect to have the CFO in attendance for this presentation. Ask for the CFOs name and email address so that an invitation can be sent to them as well. You might include link to overview video when sending invitations to people who did not attend the overview presentation. We really do not want to conduct this presentation demo without the decision maker.<br>
          <br></li>
      
        <li>The Supplier Match presentation and platform demo is conducted. This includes a:
      
          <ul>
            <li>Review, explanation, and justification of the estimated conversion rate as well as the estimated rebate.</li>
      
            <li>Demo of the payment platform</li>
      
            <li>Discussion of enrollment process</li>
      
            <li>Review of the agreement</li>
          </ul>This presentation concludes with the presenter scheduling the kick off call.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      
        <li>An agreement is created and sent to prospect for electronic signature.<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>Reminders will be automatically sent to prospects who have not yet e-signed the agreement.<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>Agreement is received<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>A kick off call is conducted<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>Client is setup and the enrollment team starts contacting the suppliers to enroll in their acceptance of virtual card payments. All suppliers will be contacted.<br>
          <br>Since most organizations are seeking to move as many suppliers as possible to electronic payments, at the clientsâ€™ request, the enrollment team may ask suppliers who paid by check and who does not wish to accept Virtual Cards, if they would be willing to accept ACH for their customer. This value-added service is available at no cost to the client and further reduces their per invoice processing costs.<br>
        <br></li>
      
        <li>Once implemented: your clients start saving money on processing costs and receiving a monthly rebate, and you will be paid each month, on every virtual card payment made.</li>
